					The whole month was filled with anxiety, excitement and various possibilities of my future life. I guess that I wasn't taught to be sad about the past.

My family and I traveled to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan" target="_blank" class="content-link">四川</a> Sichuan the following day and I got my scores on the train back home.

					With the support of my family, I've decided around this time that I would be pursuing my bachelor's degree in America. The adventurous DNA of me would keep lasting until now. I like the unpredictable aspect of the future and the excitement of throwing myself into the totally dark unknowns

				<h2>Cornell summer school</h2>

					A hot summer in Ithaca, NY, with the big clock tower chimes every hour. I spent my first summer in the US. and took English for Academic Purposes and Introductory to Economics. Thank you Big Red and professor Kris Kershaw.

				<br>
					Dear Kevin,
				</br>
When I lived in Ithaca, I could hear the Cornell chimes when my windows were open.  Now I live about 10 miles south, & the chimes are one of the few things I miss.  Why is it the Middle Autumn Festival?  Here, Autumn doesn't begin until the autumnal equinox, Sept. 23 this year.   The full moon of September is called the Harvest Moon.

Your writing has certainly improved.  That will make it much easier for me to write you a good recommendation ... Why wouldn't I remember you?  I enjoyed having you as a student, and I was blown away by your yearbook.  ("Blown away" means really, really impressed.)  It's something I will treasure forever.

Thanks for writing.  It was good to hear from you!
				<br></br>
				Best regards,
				<br>Kris Kershaw</br>

					Another mid-summer excitement in the east coast. I studied and learned, laughed and yelled. Most importantly, I met one of my best friends for life, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicoascoli/es" target="_blank" class="content-link">Federico 'Fragi' Ascoli</a>. Oh I had a lick of the intermediate microeconomic theories in the Microeconomic Theory.
